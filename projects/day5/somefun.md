## 💬 Step 1: Let’s Chat with AI!

Now that we understand how AI works, let's try talking to one!

### Try It Yourself

🔗 Open one of these in your browser:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)     *(free account needed)*
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)   *(free account needed)*
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)           *(free account needed)*

### Sample Prompts
Try typing these fun questions:
- "Write a funny story about a robot who loves pizza."
- "What would happen if a dog could code Python?"
- "Explain gravity like I'm 10."

👀 **What to Observe:**
- How fast does it reply?
- Does the answer make sense?
- Does it sound like a real person?


## 🤖 Step 2: Activity — Ask 3 AIs the Same Question

Let’s test how different AIs answer the same question.

### Step-by-Step

1. Ask this question:
   > "If I gave you a cookie, what would you say?"

2. Ask it to:
   - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)   *(free account needed)* 
   - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)  *(free account needed)*
   - [Claude](https://claude.ai/)         *(free account needed)*

3. Compare your answers.

### Discuss:
- Which one was funniest?
- Which one sounded most human?
- Did any repeat your words?


## 💡 Group Reflection

Let’s talk about what we saw today!

### Discussion Questions:
- What surprised you?
- Did any AI sound **real**?
- What made the answer good or bad?
- Could you tell it's not a human? How?

🧠 **Remember:**
These models don’t “think” like us - yet!.  
They just guess the next best word — really well!


## 📚 Step 7: Homework (To-Do)

Here are your missions before the next class 🕵️

### ✅ Task List:
- [ ] Write **3 cool prompts** that made ChatGPT or Gemini say something funny or amazing
- [ ] Find an AI-generated image (use ChatGPT or Gemini), and explain what prompt may have made it
- [ ] Bonus: Ask ChatGPT to explain something you already know (e.g. "What is water?") — did it do a good job?

🎉 Bring your notes next class — we’ll build your own chatbot using Python!
