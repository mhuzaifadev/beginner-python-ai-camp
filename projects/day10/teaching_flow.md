## 🎬 Session 1: What is a Website?

### **Goal:** Understand how websites work and create our first page

### **What Kids Learn:**
- How websites are like digital books
- How to create a simple webpage
- Basic programming concepts

### **Code We Write:**
```python
# Step 1: Our first website
import streamlit as st

st.title("🤖 My First Website!")
st.write("Hello! This is my website!")
```

### **Teaching Points:**
- **Analogy:** "A website is like a digital book that everyone can read"
- **Explain:** "We're using a tool called Streamlit that makes websites easy to create"
- **Show:** How the code creates what they see on screen

### **Activity:**
- Let kids change the title and see what happens
- Add their own messages using `st.write()`
- Show how code = what appears on screen

---

## 🎨 Session 2: Making Things Look Pretty

### **Goal:** Learn to make websites look nice and interactive

### **What Kids Learn:**
- How to add buttons and inputs
- How to organize information
- Basic UI design concepts

### **Code We Write:**
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("🤖 My Smart Reading Buddy!")

# Add a sidebar (like a toolbox)
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("🛠️ My Toolbox")
    
    # Add a file uploader
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("📁 Drop your file here!")
    
    # Add a button
    if st.button("🚀 Start Reading!"):
        st.write("You clicked the button!")
```

### **Teaching Points:**
- **Analogy:** "The sidebar is like a toolbox on the side of your screen"
- **Explain:** "Buttons are like switches that do something when you click them"
- **Show:** How different parts of the screen have different jobs

### **Activity:**
- Let kids add their own buttons
- Change colors and emojis

- How to extract text from PDFs
- Basic file handling concepts

### **Code We Write:**
```python
import streamlit as st
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

def read_pdf_file(pdf_file):
    """
    📖 This function reads PDF files like a super-fast reader!
    """
    pdf_reader = PdfReader(pdf_file)
    text = ""
    
    # Read each page
    for page_number, page in enumerate(pdf_reader.pages):
        st.write(f"📄 Reading page {page_number + 1}")
        text += page.extract_text()
    
    return text

# Use our function
if uploaded_file:
    all_text = read_pdf_file(uploaded_file)
    st.write("📚 Here's what I read:")
    st.write(all_text[:500] + "...")  # Show first 500 characters
```

### **Teaching Points:**
- **Analogy:** "Reading a PDF is like having someone read a book to the computer"

- **Show:** How the computer processes information step by step

### **Activity:**
- Upload different PDFs and see what happens
- Compare how different files look when read
- Discuss what the computer is actually doing

## 🧠 Session 4: Talking to AI

### **Goal:** Learn how to make the computer understand and respond to questions

### **What Kids Learn:**
- What AI is and how it works
- How to ask questions and get answers
- Basic natural language processing concepts

### **Code We Write:**
```python
import streamlit as st
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

def create_ai_friend(api_key):
    """
    🤖 This creates our smart AI friend!
    """
    ai_friend = ChatOpenAI(
        api_key=api_key,
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        temperature=0.1
    )
    return ai_friend

def ask_ai_question(ai_friend, question, context):
    """
    💬 This asks our AI friend a question!
    """
    prompt = f"Based on this text: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
    
    response = ai_friend.invoke(prompt)
    return response.content

# Use our AI friend
api_key = st.text_input("🔑 Secret Key (ask a grown-up!)", type="password")
if api_key and uploaded_file:
    ai_friend = create_ai_friend(api_key)
    
    question = st.text_input("Ask me anything about your file!")
    if question:
        answer = ask_ai_question(ai_friend, question, all_text)
        st.write("🤖 AI Answer:", answer)
```

### **Teaching Points:**
- **Analogy:** "AI is like a very smart friend who read every book in the library"
- **Explain:** "We give the AI some text and a question, and it finds the answer"
- **Show:** How the AI processes information differently than humans

### **Activity:**
- Ask different types of questions
- See how the AI responds
- Discuss what makes a good question

        st.session_state.chat_history = []
    
    # File upload and processing
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("📁 Drop your PDF here!")
    api_key = st.text_input("🔑 Secret Key", type="password")
    
    if st.button("🚀 Start Reading!") and uploaded_file and api_key:
        # Read the file
        all_text = read_pdf_file(uploaded_file)
        
        # Create AI friend
        ai_friend = create_ai_friend(api_key)
        
        # Chat interface
        question = st.chat_input("Ask me anything!")
        if question:
            answer = ask_ai_question(ai_friend, question, all_text)
            
            # Save our conversation
            st.session_state.chat_history.append(('user', question))
            st.session_state.chat_history.append(('bot', answer))
            
            # Show our chat
            show_chat()

def show_chat():
    """
    💬 Shows our conversation in a nice way!
    """
    for sender, message in st.session_state.chat_history:
        if sender == 'user':
            st.markdown(f"🧒 You: {message}")
        else:
            st.markdown(f"🤖 Bot: {message}")
