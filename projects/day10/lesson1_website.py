# 🎬 LESSON 1: What is a Website?
# This is our first step in building our smart reading buddy!

import streamlit as st

# 🎯 What we're learning today:
# - How to create a simple website
# - How code becomes what you see on screen
# - Basic programming concepts

# 📝 Step 1: Let's make our first website!
st.title("🤖 My First Website!")
st.write("Hello! This is my website!")

# 🎮 Try changing these lines and see what happens!
# Change "My First Website!" to something else
# Change "Hello!" to your own message

# 📝 Step 2: Let's add some more stuff
st.header("📚 About Me")
st.write("I'm learning to code and build cool things!")

# 🎨 Step 3: Let's make it colorful
st.markdown("**This text is bold!**")
st.markdown("*This text is italic!*")

# 🎯 Challenge for you:
# 1. Change the title to your name
# 2. Add a new section about your favorite hobby
# 3. Try adding some emojis!

# 💡 What you learned:
# - st.title() makes big titles
# - st.write() adds regular text
# - st.header() makes medium-sized headers
# - st.markdown() lets you format text with **bold** and *italic*

# 🚀 Next time: We'll learn how to add buttons and make things interactive!
